Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from large volumes of data in various forms, either structured or unstructured,[1][2] which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining and predictive analytics, as well as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD).
